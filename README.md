# Random Fun Fact Generator

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This Random Fun Fact Generator is a simple web application that displays a random fun fact when the user clicks a button. The facts are stored in an array, and JavaScript is used to randomly select and display a fact every time the button is clicked.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Chose This Project  
I created this project to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with arrays. It was a great way to reinforce my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS while making a fun and interactive experience.
