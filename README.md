<h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h2>
<p>This Random Fun Fact Generator is a simple web application that displays a random fun fact when the user clicks a button. The facts are stored in an array, and JavaScript is used to randomly select and display a fact every time the button is clicked.</p>

<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Why I Chose This Project</h2>
<p>I created this project to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with arrays. It was a great way to reinforce my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS.</p>
